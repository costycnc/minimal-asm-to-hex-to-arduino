 1.I create two buttons because exists arduino with 57600 bauds and 115200. you have no way of knowing what arduino have,so... try first button ... if procent non increase ... disconnect and reconnect usb and try with second button!


2.In this box you can put the hex code. So open your hex file with notepad ... copy text and put in this box.And upload to arduino.
